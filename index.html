            <h1>Hey, I'm Charlie!</h1>
            <h2>Product Manager | Aspiring Programmer | Sports Enthusiast</h2>
            <p>
                My name's Charlie Conner. I'm originally from Maryland, where I received my bachelors degree from Towson University in 2013.
                <br>
                I majored in sports management with a minor in business. After graduation, I received my NMLS accreditation and began working in the mortgage space.
                <br>
                I worked for a few different companies in a variety of roles spanning sales, operations management, processing and underwriting.
                <br>
                Before eventually leaving the mortgage industry, I spent my final 2 years with a mortgage tech start-up, Better.com, where I had the opportunity to work on major partnerships and pilot programs.
                <br>
                After 8 years in the industry I decided to look into alternative industries and roles.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'd always had a desire to be in a role that required more technical skills. I wasn't sure if that was going to be a form of web development, data science or something else.
                <br>
                I spent time at Better.com assisting the product team as a liason between them and our client base.
                <br>
                I really enjoyed the entire process of gathering feedback, translating and communicating that in a technical format, and observing the roll out of changes and optimizations.
                <br>
                After being with Better.com for 2 years, I started with Pingtree in 2022 is where I remain today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pingtree is a small bootstrapped SaaS startup which provides businesses with an application geared towards helping them optimize their performance marketing strategies.
                <br>
                I'll provide so more information on Pingtree in a bit.
                <br>
                At the time when I started, we had just purchased the domain "pingtree.com" so it was quite literally the begining.
                <br>
                With Pingtree being a small team trying to scale, my role changed (or adapted rather) based upon business needs.
                <br>
                I initially started out in more of a project manager role, however that quickly changed to a product-specifc role.
                <br>
                In addition to this, I lead our account management team as we build out our user-base.

            <p>
                Pingtree is an e2e marketing analytics platform helping businesses optimize their marketing strategy.
                <br>
                We are vertical agnostic and can help businesses improve their digital campaigns and overall brand presence no matter the industry.
                <br>
                There are 4 phases that allow for this:
                <br>
                ###Landing Page and Offer Builder
                <br>
                Pingtree allows users to easily build, deploy and optimize landing pages and dynamic offers focused on lead generation.
                <br>
                We've removed the need for businesses to retain or outsource resources for building these webpages as it can be done all in a codeless environment in Pingtree.
                <br>
                Managing the UX/UI, lead flow logic and perform a/b testing is all simplified.
                <br>
                ###Lead Source Tracking and Attribution
                <br>
                Pingtree lets users manage their lead source tracking through easy unique link and API generation, and granular data attribution.
                <br>
                Understanding where leads were generated, down to the specific creative that was clicked on, is incredibly important when deciding where marketing budgets should be allocated.
                <br>
                ###Lead Distribution
                <br>
                Pingtree has created numerous configurations for lead distribution to buyers and their CRM's.
                <br>
                Pingtree makes it easy to map and deliver data via server to server connections.
                <br>
                ###Analysis and Reporting
                <br>
                Pingtree was built as a performance analytics platform.
                <br>
                We use the 3 prior phases to help facilitate all of this, but the analytics resources Pingtree offers is what ensures all of the data that's gathered can be molded in way to make informed decisions.
