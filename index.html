            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name's Charlie Conner. I'm originally from Maryland, where I received my bachelor’s degree from Towson University in 2013.
                I majored in sports management with a minor in business. After graduation, I received my NMLS accreditation and began working in the mortgage space.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked for a few different companies in a variety of roles spanning sales, operations management, processing, and underwriting.
                Before eventually leaving the mortgage industry, I spent my final 2 years with a mortgage tech start-up, Better.com, where I had the opportunity to work on major partnerships and pilot programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                After 8 years in the industry, I decided to explore alternative industries and roles. <br><br>
                I’ve always wanted to be in a more technical role, whether in web development, data science, or something else.
            </p>
            <p>
                While at Better.com, I assisted the product team as a liaison between them and our clients. I enjoyed the process of gathering feedback, translating it into technical formats, and watching the rollout of changes and optimizations.
                After two years at Better.com, I started with Pingtree in 2022, where I remain today.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pingtree is a small bootstrapped SaaS startup that provides businesses with an application to optimize their performance marketing strategies. I'll share more information about Pingtree shortly.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I started, we had just purchased the domain "pingtree.com," so it was quite literally the beginning. My role, initially project management, shifted to a more product-focused one as we scaled. 
                I also lead our account management team as we build out our user base.

            <p>
                Pingtree is an e2e marketing analytics platform helping businesses optimize their marketing strategy.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                We are vertical agnostic and can help businesses improve their digital campaigns and overall brand presence no matter the industry.
            </p>
                <h4>There are 4 phases that allow for this:</h4>
                <h4>Landing Page and Offer Builder</h4>
            
                Pingtree allows users to easily build, deploy and optimize landing pages and dynamic offers focused on lead generation.
                We've removed the need for businesses to retain or outsource resources for building these webpages as it can be done all in a codeless environment in Pingtree.
                <br>
                Managing the UX/UI, lead flow logic and perform a/b testing is all simplified.
                <br>
                <h4>Lead Source Tracking and Attribution</h4>
        
                Pingtree lets users manage their lead source tracking through easy unique link and API generation, and granular data 
                attribution.
                <br>
                Understanding where leads were generated, down to the specific creative that was clicked on, is incredibly important when 
                deciding where marketing budgets should be allocated.
                <br>
                <h4>Lead Distribution </h4>
               
                Pingtree has created numerous configurations for lead distribution to buyers and their CRM's.
                Pingtree makes it easy to map and deliver data via server to server connections.
                <br>
                <h4>Analysis and Reporting</h4>
                
                Pingtree was built as a performance analytics platform.
                We use the 3 prior phases to help facilitate all of this, but the analytics resources Pingtree offers is what ensures all 
                of the data that's gathered can be molded in way to make informed decisions.
