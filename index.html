            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name's Charlie Conner. I'm originally from Maryland, where I received my bachelorâ€™s degree from Towson University in 2013.
                I majored in sports management with a minor in business. After graduation, I received my NMLS accreditation and began working in the mortgage space.
            </p>
            <p>
                I worked for a few different companies in a variety of roles spanning sales, operations management, processing, and underwriting.
                Before eventually leaving the mortgage industry, I spent my final 2 years with a mortgage tech start-up, Better.com, where I had the opportunity to work on major partnerships and pilot programs.
            </p>
            <p>
                While at Better.com, I assisted the product team as a liaison between them and our clients. I enjoyed the process of gathering feedback, translating it into technical formats, and watching the rollout of changes and optimizations.
                After two years at Better.com, I started with Pingtree in 2022, where I remain today.

            </p>
            <p>
               After 8 years in the mortgage industry, I decided to explore alternative industries and roles. <br><br>
               I always saw myself eventually being in more of a technical technical role, whether that was web development, data science, or something else so I knew the general direction I was looking to go.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pingtree is a small bootstrapped SaaS startup that provides businesses with an application to optimize their performance marketing strategies. I'll share more information about Pingtree shortly.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I started with Pingtree, we had just purchased the domain "pingtree.com," so it was quite literally the beginning. My role, initially project management, shifted to a more product-focused one as we scaled. 
                I also lead our account management team as we build out our user base.

            <h2>Pingtree</h2>
           <h5 style="text-align: center;"> https://pingtree.com</h5>
            <p>
                Pingtree is an e2e marketing analytics platform helping businesses to analyze and optimize their digital marketing strategies.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                We are vertical agnostic and can help businesses improve their digital campaigns and overall brand presence no matter the industry.
            </p>
                <h3>There are 4 major components we have built in Pingtree:</h3>
                <h4>Landing Page and Offer Builder</h4>
            
                Pingtree allows users to easily build, deploy and optimize landing pages and dynamic offers focused on lead generation.
                We've removed the need for businesses to retain or outsource resources for building these webpages as it can be done all in a codeless environment 
                in Pingtree.
                <br>
                Managing the UX/UI, lead flow logic and performing a/b testing has all been simplified for our users.
                <br>
                <h4>Lead Source Tracking and Attribution</h4>
        
                Pingtree lets users manage their lead source tracking through easy unique link and API generation, and data attribution down the most granular levels            
                <br>
            
                Understanding where your lead traffic was generated, down to the specific creative that was clicked on, is incredibly important when 
                deciding where marketing budgets should be allocated.
                <br>
                <h4>Lead Distribution </h4>
               
                Pingtree has created numerous configurations for lead distribution to buyers and their CRM's.
                We've made it easy to map and deliver data via server to server connections and webhooks..
                <br>
                <h4>Analysis and Reporting</h4>
                
                Pingtree was built as a performance analytics platform. We use the 3 prior phases to help facilitate all of this, but the analytics resources Pingtree offers 
                is what ensures all of the data that's gathered can be molded in way for our users to make informed decisions.
