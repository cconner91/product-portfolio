        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hey there, my name is Charlie. I attended Towson University where I played baseball and ended up graduating with degrees in Sports Management and Business Administration.

           While I'm an East Coast guy to my core but I've lived in sunny SoCal with my wife for the last 4 years (rough life, I know). 

            I'm a huge dog lover and have 2 good boys. Oakley's a Golden Retriever-Hound mix (sounds like a seal) and Bodie is a red golden.
            I'm an avid sports fan and I'm passionate about sports analytics. Especially in the betting market.

             After graduating I began my career in the mortgage industry. I worked in sales, management, operations and underwriting. While living in California, I worked for a mortgage tech company
             called Better Mortgage. It was here where fell in love with technology and the user stories behind our product. I was fascinated with improving all aspects of the user journey and our 
             dynamic platform; UX/UI, user flows, data analysis, optimization and all of the other components that stand in front of a company and implementing a great B2C product.

            After leaving Better, I knew I wanted my next role to be within the product realm. With limited direct experience in product, I knew I needed to level up my skillset and knowledge
            so I listened to every product podcast I could find, read product books, took classes and started putting together my own projects. I learn best by doing.

            I was lucky enough to find a role at an early stage startup called Pingtree. It was here where I have been immersed in the product world. As well as, engineering, project management, data analysis, 
            SaaS sales, revenue ops and all of the roles one takes on at a small and scrappy startup.

            <h3>Pingtree (https://pingtree.com) </h3>

        <p>    
            We are a SaaS company who's developed an angular based web application geared towards providing users with full funnel marketing and analytics platform. Our small team has taken a vision and turned 
            it into an incredibly complex and dynamic platform that's highly capable. While there are other applications and platforms in the lead generation and marketing analytics space,
            there aren't any that allow users the functionality all-in-one. 

            Throughout the last year, we have developed and implemented several modules including: 

                <list>

                    1. Campaign Management
                    2. Media Buying
                    3. Creatives Library
                    4. Treehouse: A unique marketplace which allows users to faciliate the buying and/or selling of lead traffic in any business vertical
                    5. Real-Time Payments and User Wallet Integration
                    6. Webflows
                    7. Route 53 DNS Services for easy domain integration and connections

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>SharkLine Sports</h3>
            <h4>Concept</h4>
            <p>I wanted to work on a project that I was passionate as well as knowledgeable about. As an avid sports fan, I thought there would be no better place to explore than a sports application.

                I first began thinking of any current problems or needs that could be fulfilled. My mind turned to sports betting and DFS (Daily Fantasy Sports). With the sports gaming market being 
                one of the fastest growing and emerging industries in the country, I knew there were some deficiencies that existed.

                I've always been fascinated by trends. When it came to sports gambling, or any other investment-related craft, I enjoyed tracking data and comparing it against historical analytics. Simply having an
                clear and concise view of performance metrics could help someone identify certain trends and use that data to make optimizations.

                With the emergence of DraftKings, Fanduel, Underdog and all of these sports betting/DFS applications, I hadn't seen a full-scale optimization tool that could be used alongside those applications. </p>

                This is when I decided to begin SharkLine Sports. A sports betting and DFS portfolio management application. I wanted to allow users to have a simplified way to not only keep track of their bets, profits, losses and 
                bankroll management, but also give them a tool to make strategy adjustments. My goal was to deliver user stories with a clean and modern UX/UI. </p>
                
            <h4>Project Framework</h4>
            <p> I put together a product roadmap, analyzing everything from the the framework and tech stack that should be used, to each and every user story that would be in my beta version.

                I created the architecture for my Github repo's and branches. I used Figma to design the application layout and Photoshop to create an eye-catching logo and color scheme.

                While I work each day alongside our engineering and development teams, and have a base understanding of web development, I am far from an expert in dev ops, code structure, DNS and overall code-level architecture.

                While this made it a bit more challenging (and time consuming) than it would have for web developer, it has helped me gain a better understanding of building and integrating an application
                with a full stack approach. 
                
                In my Product Roadmap, I included the following user stories I wanted to accomplish:</p>

        
              <h5>Main Lander</h5>

               <p>The home page for the user where they're able to access their account</p>
            
                <h5>Analytics</h5>

                <p> 
                    Sports Bet Input Tool
                    Profit and Loss Statements 
                    Profit Tracking Chart
                    Trend Analyzer
                    Odds Calculator and Bet Builder
                    
                </p>
                <h5>DFS</h5>
                The DFS section contains lineup optimizers, 
                </p>
                
            
            </p>
